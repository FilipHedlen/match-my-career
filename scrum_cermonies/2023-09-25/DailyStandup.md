### Daily standup

Last friday the group revamped our design which resulted in improvements and alterations for both the color palette and layout.
Today each of us will keep working a bit on the design for one of our projects pages, as well as adding some more functionality where it's needed.
The header and the footer and some global styling will be fixed as well.

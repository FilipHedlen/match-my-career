### Daily standup

Today the group reviewed and merged a few PR's. The members also created a temporary bug fix for AboutEducationView. 
Afterwards the group discussed and filled in Retrospective. The Retrospective can be found in scrum_cermonies/2023-09-21.
Together the group concluded a refreshment on the design as well as component rendering, therefore that will be the main focus today.

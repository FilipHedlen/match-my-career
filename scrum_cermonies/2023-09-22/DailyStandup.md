Today the group sat together and finished the routing structure and discussed some design choices.
Today each of us will work on the design for one of our projects pages, as well as adding some more functionality where it's needed.

### Filip

Today I will work on the overall design of our About page, I will also rewrite some code to match our new routing structure.
